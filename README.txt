I included a screencast of the section3 code running in demo.mp4

- These instructions are for Windows
- The subdirectories are in "src\csc481hw2"
- Import the csc481hw2 folder in Eclipse

# Section 2
- run "Server.java" as a java application
- open three cmd.exe terminals and make working directory the folder you extracted the files to
- in each terminal run this command:
   java -jar Client2.jar 127.0.0.1
   
# Section 3
- Exact same instructions as Section to except run Client3.jar
